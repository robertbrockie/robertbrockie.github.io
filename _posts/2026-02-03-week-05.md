Was a bit nervous trying the new program today. Started things off with a Pull day, set list looked like this:

- Pull-ups  
- T-bar rows  
- Bent-over cable rows  
- Reverse pec deck  
- Cable curls  

I’ve been running pyramid-style sets since university, and honestly, it’s worked pretty well for me. I’m an old dog and this is a new trick — but I have to admit, the first session went really well.

I kept warm-ups light, then really drove intensity on the working sets. Fewer sets, but much more focus. I’m hopeful this style of training will help put some size on my aging frame.

At lunch I hit a light **30 minutes on the elliptical**. Plan for tomorrow is legs — I’ll map that out and rest up tonight.
