Was nervous trying the new program today, a pull day with the following setlist:

- Pull-ups
- T-bar rows
- Bentover cable rows
- Reverse pec deck
- Cable curls

I've been doing the kind of pyramid sets since I was in university, and it's worked pretty well for me. I'm an old dog and this is a new trick, but I have to admit the first session went really well. Did light warmups for each exercise then really drove the intensity on the working sets. I'm hopefully this style of training will put some size on my old frame.

At lunch I hit a light 30 minutes on the elliptical. The plan for tomorrow is legs, will plan that out and rest up tonight.
