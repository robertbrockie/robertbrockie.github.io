Woke up this morning totally exhausted, but still made it to Gold’s on time for a solid **40 minutes on the elliptical**. Then worked, ate, and hit arms at lunch with the following set list:

- Cable curls  
- Triceps rope pushdowns  
- Machine preacher curls  
- Machine pushdowns  
- DB single-arm preacher curls  
- DB triceps extensions  

Even with the exhaustion, I still managed to get a solid pump. This was my first time trying DB single-arm preacher curls — I can still feel a bit of a tinge in my forearms from them — but the pump afterward was great.

I was watching some Jeff Nippard videos on arm exercise tier lists, and he made a good point about how “not optimal” DB triceps extensions can be. I’ll focus more on cable-based extensions going forward.

Taking a well-earned rest day tomorrow. I’ve got some curling in the morning and family coming in the afternoon. Plan is to rest up, read up on posing and judging, and eat enough to be ready to get back at it Sunday morning — thinking legs with some abs thrown in.

### Notes
- Weight up to **172.8 lbs** (up **0.6 lbs** from yesterday)  
- Try straight-bar triceps pushdowns next time  
- Remove DB triceps extensions from the rotation  

### TODO
- Build spreadsheet for weights and reps  
- Research posing and judging
