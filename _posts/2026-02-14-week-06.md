💘 Happy Valentine’s Day to the trap bar. 💘

YMCA lower body set list this lovely morning:

- Trap bar deadlift  
- Seated leg curls  
- Single-leg curls  
- Hip thrusts  
- Calf raises  

Felt really strong on the trap bar deadlift — I’ll push the weight up next week. I’m also starting to max out the standing calf raise machine, so I might need to bring an extra pin to add more weight.

Jumped into the sauna for **15 minutes** afterward and worked on vacuums and some stretching.

Taking the family to St-Hubert for dinner this evening. Only the best for my family. 💘

### Notes
- Weight at **175.6 lbs**

### TODO
