Slept great and made it to Gold’s early with plenty of time to hit shoulders and arms. Morning set list:

- Poliquin raises  
- Seated DB shoulder press  
- Cable lateral raises  
- Cable curls  
- Cable straight-bar pushdowns  
- Rear delt flyes  
- Machine preacher curls  
- Cable standing triceps extensions  
- DB lateral raises  

Solid session overall. Really felt the triceps pump. I did try some single-arm rear delt flyes, but they didn’t feel particularly comfortable — might need to revisit those or adjust the setup.

Lunch time cardio was **30 mins** on the elliptical. Time to chew through some podcasts at 1.8x speed.

Last night I emailed Shaun about the IDAF → [Workout Warrior Athletics](https://www.workoutwarriorathletics.com) rebrand, and he got back to me bright and early this morning. Looks like nothing has really changed besides the name, and the Montreal [July 19th show](https://www.workoutwarriorathletics.com/2026-show-dates) is still on.

I was pretty nervous it might get cancelled, so that was great news. I’ll check back in with Shaun closer to the show to see if any of the judging criteria have changed — one thing at a time.

### Notes
- Weight up to **173.4 lbs**

### TODO
- Research posing and judging  
- Graph lift data  
- Buy tiny shorts
