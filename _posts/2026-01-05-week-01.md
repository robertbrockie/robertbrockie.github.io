Back to work after the holidays, which means I’m back at Gold’s. Got there early for **30 minutes on the elliptical**, then hit shoulders at lunch with the following set list:

- Poliquin raises  
- Overhead press  
- Rear delt flyes  
- Machine shoulder press  
- Cable lateral raises  
- Oblique swings  

I’d never heard of Poliquin raises before seeing [Cbum do them on IG](https://www.instagram.com/reels/DPO13HSjfWF/). They worked well as a starter to get the creaks out. I also haven’t hit overhead press in a while — felt good.

For the rear delt flyes, I went a bit lighter (around **125 lbs**) but slowed everything way down. Great pump.

Gold’s was packed. Looking forward to February.

Also forgot that I start a curling tournament tonight (big loss). Will have to plan accordingly.

### Notes
- Add Poliquin raises to the rotation

### TODO
- Build spreadsheet for weights and reps  
- Research posing and judging
