title: "Week 2 – Legs – 💩 RDL Form"

Start of Week 2. Bright and early with a **35-minute** elliptical session, then a 1 p.m. leg workout at Gold’s:

- Hack squat  
- Leg curl  
- Leg extension  

Great lifts overall. Drop-set everything at the end to absolute failure. Didn’t have enough time for calf raises — I’ll punish them later this week.

I also took a quick video of my RDL form and… woof. Total shit. Going to chat with some trainer friends at the Y and see if I can get that cleaned up. Perhaps switch to a dumbbell variation in the meantime.

I also cleaned up my nutrition plan using the [Macrofactor app](https://macrofactor.com/) to try and push toward **180 lbs by March**. Feels like I’ve got some decent meals figured out that should help me consistently hit my protein target. My belle-mère got me an air fryer for Christmas, so I’ll do a bit of research on how to make chicken breasts taste better than whatever currently comes out of my crock pot.

Finally, I knocked out a bit of my TODO list and spun up a repo for tracking my lifts. It’s not 100% yet, but it’s a start. You can find it [here](https://github.com/robertbrockie/robertbrockie.github.io). It’s not ready for general use, but if you have any programming experience and want to track your lifts in a dumb JSON format, feel free to steal it.

### Notes
- Weight still **172.6 lbs** (hoping that changes this week)

### TODO
- Research posing and judging 
- Graph lift data
