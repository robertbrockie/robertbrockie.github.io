title: "Week 5 – Rest – Program Switch-Up"

Much-needed rest day today. Got **30 minutes on the elliptical** at lunch — lighter than normal — and I’ve got ball hockey tonight.

I spent a good chunk of the day uploading training data into ChatGPT and reviewing my January volume. The conclusion was pretty obvious: I’m doing *a lot* of work, but not all of it is high quality. So starting tomorrow, I’m switching programs.

The focus going forward is **less volume, more intent** — heavier loads, fewer sets, and truly hard reps. This style comes up a lot when listening to coaches online, and even Dorian Yates swears by it (yes, I know — different era, different chemistry). Still, the principle makes sense, especially given recovery and life constraints.

Below is the plan I’ll be running for February.

# February Training Plan — PPLUL  
**High Intensity • Low Junk Volume**

This block is built from my January training data. The goal is **better stimulus-to-fatigue management**, improved recovery, and measurable progress — while fitting around ball hockey and real life.

---

## Training Philosophy

### Core Goals
- Reduce junk volume  
- Emphasize **2–3 true working sets** per exercise  
- Train most muscles **twice per week**  
- Improve stimulus-to-fatigue ratio  
- Prioritize **back and delts**, maintain legs, protect joints  

### What Counts as a Hard Set
A set only counts if:
- It’s within **0–2 reps of failure (RIR 0–2)**
- Rep speed noticeably slows
- Load requires full focus and clean execution

Anything easier = warm-up or prep.

---

## Global Rules (Non-Negotiable)

### Warm-Up Sets
- Ramp gradually
- Perform as many warm-ups as needed
- **Warm-up sets do NOT count** toward volume

### Working Sets
- **Compound lifts:** 2 hard sets  
- **Isolation lifts:** 2–3 hard sets  
- If performance drops by **>10%**, stop the exercise

### Weekly Hard-Set Targets

| Muscle Group | Sets / Week |
|-------------|-------------|
| Chest | 10–12 |
| Back | 12–14 *(priority)* |
| Delts | 12–14 |
| Quads | 10–12 |
| Hamstrings / Glutes | 8–10 |
| Arms | 6–8 |

---

## Weekly Layout

- **Monday** – Push  
- **Tuesday** – Pull  
- **Wednesday** – Legs  
- **Thursday** – Off / Light Cardio / Mobility  
- **Friday** – Upper (Back + Delts Bias)  
- **Saturday** – Lower (Posterior Chain Bias)  
- **Sunday** – Off

---

### 🟢 LEGS — Quad Bias

4. Calves

Focus on control. Avoid grinders.

---

### 🟣 UPPER — Back + Delts Bias
1. Row variation (different from Pull day)  
   • 3 hard sets  

2. Incline DB Press (lighter than Push day)  
   • 2 hard sets × 8–12  

3. Lateral Raises  
   • 3 hard sets × 12–20  

4. Rear Delts (different variation)  
   • 2–3 hard sets  

5. *(Optional)* Arms superset  
   • 1–2 light pump sets

2. Seated or Lying Leg Curl  
   • 3 hard sets × 8–12  

3. Optional single-leg work  
   • 2 controlled sets  

4. Calves  
   • 2–3 hard sets  

---

## Progression & Recovery

- **Double progression** within rep ranges  
- Poor sleep → reduce sets, keep intensity  
- Hockey fatigue → reduce lower-body volume next session  

**Deload trigger:**  
- Strength stalls for 2 weeks  
- Joint irritation  
- Motivation dip  

Deload = ~60–70% volume for one week.

---

## Final Notes

This plan is about **intentional effort, not exhaustion**.

Run for **3–4 weeks**, review data, then adjust.

### Notes
- Weight at **173.0 lbs** (jinxed it)

### TODO
- Research posing and judging
