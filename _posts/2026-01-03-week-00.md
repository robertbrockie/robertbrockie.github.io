Back was on the menu this morning at the YMCA with the following setlist:

- Pullups
- Trap Bar Deadlifts
- Bentover Cable Rows
- Seated Cable Rows
- Seated Pulldowns
- Incline Treadmill (20min)
- Sauana (15min)

Normally I do regular deadlifts, which I really love but as I was putting up some bigger weight (405 singles) I felt I might fuck something up. So I went with trap bar deadlifts which seem to be a bit safer. Until after July's show my focus should be on simple and safe lifts. Focus on **contractions** and **form** (this is very hard my inner toxic masculinity).
