Sunday is always a bit wild at the YMCA. Both kids had activities to juggle, but everything went off without any issues.

Hit legs this morning:

- Squats  
- Front squats  
- Lying leg curls  
- Leg extensions  
- Seated leg curls  
- Calf raises  

Started off feeling a bit weak, but the last couple of squat sets were amazing. Finished the session with a lot of slow, controlled squeezing — felt great. Wrapped things up with **30 minutes on the elliptical** to finish the day.

Later, I took my kids into the functional strength room and put together a little boot camp for them. They seemed to love it. Their current goal is to dead hang longer than **30 seconds**.

I was planning on taking a rest day tomorrow, but I’m feeling pretty good. I’ll see what the morning brings — if I’m up for it, I’ll hit back. Otherwise, rest.

Now it’s time to focus on getting my little gym notebook into something I can actually graph.

### Notes
- Weight at **175.6 lbs** 

### TODO
- Research posing and judging  
- Graph lift data
