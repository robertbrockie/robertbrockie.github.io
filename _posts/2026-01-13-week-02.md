Feeling great this morning and made it to Gold’s early, so I swapped my usual morning cardio for a back session and hit the following set list:

- T-bar rows  
- Seated lat pulldowns  
- Bent-over cable rows  
- Trap bar deadlifts  

Overall felt great — solid back pump. Pushed cardio (**40 minutes on the elliptical**) to lunchtime instead.

Got an email from IDAF today. Looks like they’re rebranding to **WWA (Workout Warrior Athletics)**. From what I can tell, everything *seems* the same, but I’m not sure if the competition is still in July or even if it’s run in the same format 😡.

I’ve seen similar competitions around June/July, but I don’t really know how they’re run, and that makes me a lot less comfortable than I was with IDAF. I’ll email them and see if I can get some clarity.

### Notes
- Weight still **172.6 lbs** (…trust the process)

### TODO
- Research posing and judging  
- Graph lift data
- Buy tiny shorts
- Email Shaun about IDAF rebrand
