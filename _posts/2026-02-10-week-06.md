Slept in a bit this morning after getting home late from hockey, so I hit Gold’s at lunch for a pull session:

- Pull-ups  
- Low rows  
- Reverse pec deck  
- Seated close-grip rows  
- Machine preacher curls  

Straightforward session, got it done.

Looks like a ton of snow coming down tonight, so I’ll get home early and shovel for cardio.
