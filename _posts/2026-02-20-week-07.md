> Set 2: 10 lbs x 5 reps  
>

Overall, great session. PR’d on weighted dips and T-bar rows. Feeling very strong.

Back to the office where I’m surrounded by sick people, trying to avoid catching whatever they’ve got.

Canada beat Finland 3–2 to make it to the gold medal game. High stress before I hit **25 minutes on the elliptical**. Crushed some Vitamin C mix and headed home.

Still feeling the effects of Wednesday’s gorilla hack squat session. Need to rest up before lower body tomorrow.

### Notes
- Weight at **174.2 lbs**
