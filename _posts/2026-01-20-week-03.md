title: "Week 3 – Chest – Supplement Stack"

Working from home today, so I hit the YMCA for a **7 a.m.** chest session:

- Decline bench press  
- Incline DB bench press  
- Pec deck  
- Cable press  

Very straightforward lifts, but a great lower-chest pump. Finished things off with **15 minutes in the sauna**, then back to work. No cardio today.

I ordered **10 lbs of protein powder** last week along with some EAA powder. It was on sale, and I’ve seen a lot of people swear by it. I’ve taken BCAAs before, but I was never totally clear on the difference.

BCAAs (branched-chain amino acids) contain three essential amino acids — leucine, isoleucine, and valine — while EAAs (essential amino acids) provide all nine: histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine.

I’m not a nutritionist, but the assumption is that having access to more of these amino acids *could* help with recovery and muscle growth. That said, I’m skeptical — so this is more of an experiment than a belief. Not expecting miracles here, but it felt worth trying.

My current supplement stack looks like this:

- Multivitamin + fish oil + zinc + vitamin D3 (morning)  
- EAA powder + water (during workouts)  
- Protein powder + creatine + water (post workout)  
- Magnesium (before bed)  

### Notes
- Weight **steady** at **173.6 lbs**  

### TODO
- Research posing and judging  
- Graph lift data  
- Buy tiny shorts
