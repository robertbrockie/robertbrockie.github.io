Wonderful restful sleep last night, got into work with enough time to get 30 mins on the elliptical before starting my day.

Great day for Canadian men's curling.

Awful day for Canadian women's hockey.

Got in a decent abs class in at lunch.

Very restful day listing to [MJ Lenderman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i07eVb1rDs0) and pumping out code.

Upper body tomorrow.
