Wonderful, restful sleep last night. Got into work early enough to get **30 minutes on the elliptical** before starting my day.

Great day for Canadian men’s curling.

Awful day for Canadian women’s hockey.

Got a decent ab class in at lunch.

Very restful day listening to [MJ Lenderman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i07eVb1rDs0) and pumping out code.

Upper body tomorrow.

### Notes
