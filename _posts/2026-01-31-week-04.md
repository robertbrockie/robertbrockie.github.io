Not the greatest sleep last night, and definitely still feeling the pizza in my belly this morning — but I made it to the YMCA nonetheless. Today’s chest and shoulders session looked like this:

- Decline bench press  
- Incline DB press  
- DB shoulder press  
- Cable press  
- Cable lateral raises  
- Dips  
- Poliquin raises  

Even with the rough sleep, my body somehow churned that pizza into an excellent chest pump 💪💪💪💪. Finished things off with **15 minutes in the sauna** working on vacuum holds.

Note to self: switch out decline barbell bench for **decline DB press** next time. The YMCA’s decline setup for dumbbells has a much better angle than the adjustable bench.

Walked home to grab my youngest, then back to the Y to watch his swim lesson and finish inputting the remaining January lifts into the Progress database. I think I’ll stick to tracking **2026 data only** for now.

Off to the grocery store this afternoon to stock up on ground chicken and rice.

### Notes
