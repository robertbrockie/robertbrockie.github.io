Woke up this morning feeling well rested and headed to the YMCA for some back and shoulder work.

- Weighted pull-ups  
- Trap bar deadlifts  
- Seated cable rows  
- Seated cable pulldowns  
- Seated assisted lat prayers  
- Face pulls  
- DB lateral raises  
- DB shrugs  

I was fuming stepping on the scale this morning. Down to **171.8 lbs**. Not doing great with the weight gain right now, so I’m going to aggressively increase protein and carbs over the next week.

I’m also still fighting that same bullshit gym mindset — wanting to go heavier for fewer reps instead of actually training the muscle. Still not sure how to fully beat that out of my head.

I need to focus on muscle contraction.  
I need to focus on muscle contraction.

Heading to the grocery store to stock up on ground chicken and rice.
