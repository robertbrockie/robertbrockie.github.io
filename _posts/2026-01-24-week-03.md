Brutal cold out this morning. Montreal is in a bit of a deep freeze this weekend, but we must soldier on if we ever want to strut around in small trunks on a stage someday.

Today’s plan was chest and shoulders, with the following set list:

- Decline bench press  
- Incline DB press  
- Lateral raises  
- Machine shoulder press  
- Machine press  
- Standing overhead triceps extensions  
- Wrist curls  
- Reverse wrist curls  

All around great lift — solid pump. Finished things off with **20 minutes in the sauna**, then trudged home to start grocery shopping and meal prep while doing whatever it takes to keep my kids inside. Screen time it up, boys.

Also worth noting: my amazing brother-in-law found some decent posing trunks, and I finally bit the bullet and [ordered a pair](https://irontanksgymgear.com/products/classic-physique-posing-trunks-matte-black?variant=41280055017566) today. It was surprisingly hard to find non-American trunks (I have my elbows firmly up), but these Aussie ones will do. Commonwealth solidarity.

### Notes
- Weight at **172.4 lbs**
