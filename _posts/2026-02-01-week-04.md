Woke up feeling weirdly fatigued this morning. Got to the YMCA planning to squat, but I just wasn’t feeling it — too tired to squat, not tired enough to sleep in. Powered through with a more machine-based leg session instead:

- Leg press  
- “Platz stance” leg press  
- Seated leg curls  
- Calf raises  
- Lying leg curls  
- Glute extensions  

Not a great pump, but I’ll take it. It was another long day at the Y, juggling the kids’ sports (basketball and volleyball), and I still managed to squeeze in **30 minutes on the elliptical**.

“Platz stance leg press” isn’t actually a thing — it's what I'm calling a regular leg press with feet low on the platform in a [V-stance](https://www.x-rep.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Tom-Platz-Top-Hack-Squat.jpg). The knee flexion felt good and it really lit up my inner quads, so I’m going to keep it in the rotation.

Off to meet a friend for ☕ — he competed in a WAA show a couple of years ago, so I’m hoping to pick his 🧠 for some tips (and catch up). After that, it’s back to some contract work. Pretty sure I’m sleeping in tomorrow.

On to Week 5.

*(Not to jinx it, but weight seems to be trending in the right direction.)*
