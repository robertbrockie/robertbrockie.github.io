title: "Week 0 – Arms and Abs Day - More planning"
---

⚖️: 175.6 lbs  

Early morning arms and abs work at the YMCA. Will continue the current (bro-split) routine until the end of the year. I spent the bulk of the day working on my training schedule for the upcoming year. Figured this would be the best split.

Monday: Push (Golds)
Tuesday: Pull (Golds)
Wednesday: Legs (Golds)
Thursday: Abs / Cardio (Golds)
Friday: Curling / Stretching (Golds)
Saturday: Upper Body (YMCA)
Sunday: Legs (YMCA)

Two rest days in the middle of the week isn't ideal, but I can't think of a better way to structure it with work. On the weekends I'm able to do longer morning sessions, and I want to keep up the ab class we have at work on Thursdays. Tomorrow I'll working on hashing out a nutrition plan to put on a bit of weight for the early part of 2026.
