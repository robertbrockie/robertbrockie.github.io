Legs were on the menu this morning, and I have to admit — this new program is working. The set list looked like this:

- Hack squat  
- Leg extensions  
- Standing leg curls  
- Calf raises  

Went heavy on each with **2–3 hard working sets** and was done in about **45 minutes**. The pump wasn’t as big as usual, but I felt *strong* — and more importantly, I wasn’t nearly as wiped out as I normally am.

Lunch time was another light **30 minutes on the elliptical**, and I was lucky enough to grab one of the great Gold’s trainers for an **InBody scan**. Figured it was a good time to get a current reading (my last scan was back in October) so I’ve got a clean baseline for this new program.

Give it **six weeks** — let’s see if I can pack some mutant mass onto this frame.

Tomorrow is planned as a rest day. I’ll probably do some light ab work with the work crew, then some stretching and easy cardio.

### Notes
- Weight at **175.4 lbs**

### TODO
- Research posing and judging
