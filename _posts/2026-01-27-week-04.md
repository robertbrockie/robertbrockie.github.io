Legs are still recovering from Sunday and ball hockey, but I still managed **30 minutes on the elliptical** this morning before hitting chest at lunch:

- Decline bench press  
- Incline Smith press  
- Wide-grip press  
- Pec deck  

Got a great pump from this session. 💪💪💪💪

Not sure what I was thinking last night when I was figuring out the cut date. The show is **July 19th** (not the 12th), and three months before that is April — not May. Math is hard. Because of that, I’m going to add a **cut-day countdown** to the site to keep it front of mind.

Hoping for a leg day tomorrow — time to put my legs up for now. The posing trunks are currently somewhere over the Pacific, but could be here by the end of the week.

### Notes
- Weight at **172.6 lbs**

### TODO
- Research posing and judging  
- Input last 4 months of lifts into the Progress section
