title: "Week 5 – Lower Body – ⛓️ Posterior Chain ⛓️"

Lower body was on the menu this morning with the following set list:

- Trap bar deadlift  
- Seated leg curls  
- Calf raises  
- Single-leg lying curls  

After the lifts I did a quick **15 minutes on the elliptical**, then jumped in the sauna for another **15 minutes**.

The original plan was to do single-leg press… however the running shorts I was wearing were a *bit* too short once you fully extend a leg. So I figured it was best for the gym community that I switch things up and stick with single-leg curls instead.

Normally I really beat the shit out of myself on these Saturday mornings at the Y since I’ve got lots of time and the gym is generally empty. But the new plan is focused on **two hard working sets**, so I was done in about **45 minutes**.

I wasn’t nearly as gassed as I normally would be, but standing in the sauna I could really feel the work in my hamstrings.

Mentally I’m still struggling with this program shift, but I’m going to trust it for now. We’ll see if working smarter (and not just harder) actually builds more muscle.

Not sure why my brain loves training as dumb and hard as possible. I’ve just got that (dumb) dog in me.

Give it six weeks. Let’s get some size on this frame.

Tomorrow is rest, meal prep, and finally digging into judging and posing.

### Notes
- Weight at **174.8 lbs**

### TODO
