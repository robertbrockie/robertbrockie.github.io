title: "Week 0 – Legs - Body Assessment"
---

Got up early this morning and did legs. Mainly focused on the leg curl and leg extentsion machines to get a great squeeze in. Finished off with the leg press, starting with single leg pressing then building up to 680 lbs for a deep 3 reps. 

Was lucky to catch one of the personal trainers who I was telling the June competition about, he said he'd be happy to give me an assessment anytime and today was a perfect day for it. Stripped down, did a couple of poses, and was told that my abs, obliques and lower chest need work, the rest of my body is solid. He said that if I work on those areas I could place in the top 3, but I'm sure he says that to all the beef cake wanna-be's.

He also mentioned that I should stay on the bro split for a bit and work the abs and obliques with each day if possible. I mean, I've never done jack shit for my obliques and lower chest, so all of this makes sense. Will continue the bro split for January and get re-assessed in February.

Will focus on nutrition tomorrow, since the gym is closed and I'll be resting.

Happy New Year!
