Another morning at Gold’s — today’s plan was legs. Felt good, not great, so I kept things more machine-focused to keep fatigue down. AM set list:

- Leg curls (seated)  
- Leg extensions  
- Leg curls (lying)  
- Hip abductions  
- Calf raises

Really good leg pump after the hour without feeling completely wrecked.

Lunch time was the Thursday special: work’s ab class, followed by a quick **20-minute** elliptical session.

Nothing too special to report today. I did add some search functionality to the site, which will probably be useful later once the posts start stacking up. Hopefully I’ll have some graphs up soon to track lifts — aiming for the weekend.

### Notes
- Weight **up** at **174.4 lbs** 🙏  

### TODO
- Research posing and judging  
- Graph lift data  
- Buy tiny shorts
