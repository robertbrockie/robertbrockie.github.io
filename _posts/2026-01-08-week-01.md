Early morning back session at Gold’s. Had to get in early because work runs an ab class during my usual 1 p.m. lift time. Simple set list:

- T-bar rows  
- Seated lat pulldowns  
- Seated low lat rows  

My favorite back movement at the moment is the T-bar row — the stretch is fucking *magnificent*.  

The lat pulldown machine I’ve been using is different from the classic cable setup. This one has independent handles, each with its own weight. I like it… but I feel like it has to have a special name.

Spent lunchtime doing some ab work with my coworkers, then matched it with a **20-minute incline walk**.

### Notes
- Weight still **172.2 lbs**, trending flat  

### TODO
- Build spreadsheet for weights and reps  
- Research posing and judging
