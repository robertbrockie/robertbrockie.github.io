Today was an arm-focused morning at Gold’s:

- Cable curls  
- Overhead cable triceps extensions  
- Machine preacher curls  
- Machine triceps extensions  
- DB preacher curls  
- DB overhead triceps extensions  

Decent pump this morning 💪💪💪. Might need to switch things up a bit next time.

Lunch time was leading my work’s ab class, followed by some incline treadmill work to finish.

Got home late this evening — the office had a trivia night, and you can probably guess whose team won 😏. Walked away with a **$100 gift certificate to Liverpool House**. Apparently the lobster spaghetti is unreal, so I’ll need to make sure I get there *before* the cut.

Not totally sure what tomorrow looks like yet — I’ll see how the body feels.

### Notes
- Weight at **175.6 lbs** 👀

### TODO
- Research posing and judging  
- Input last 4 months of lifts into the Progress section
