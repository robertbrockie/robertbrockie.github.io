Got a good rest, but the cold is still there waiting to really unload, but I persevered and hammered my quads today:

> **Hack Squat:**  
> Set 1: 315 lbs x 12 reps  
> Set 2: 315 lbs x 10 reps  

> **Leg Extensions:**  
> Set 1: 200 lbs x 12 reps  
> Set 2: 200 lbs x 10 reps  

> **Calf Raises:**  
> Set 1: 410 lbs x 13 reps  
> Set 2: 410 lbs x 11 reps  

> **Single Leg Press:**  
> Set 1: 307 lbs x 10 reps  
> Set 2: 307 lbs x 9 reps  

> **Walking Lunges:**  
> 2 laps  

Legs felt great overall but I kept myself hydrated and skipped elliptical at lunch to try and stay ahead of the cold. I have a team VR thing tonight and didn't want to be hacking all over my colleagues.
