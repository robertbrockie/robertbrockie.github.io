Perfect Saturday morning at the YMCA. Needed to get this workout in before schlepping the kids to their various sports.

Set list this morning:

> **Trap Bar Deadlift:**  
> Set 1: 295 lbs x 9 reps  
> Set 2: 295 lbs x 7 reps  

> **Seated Leg Curls:**  
> Set 1: 170 lbs x 10 reps  
> Set 2: 170 lbs x 9 reps  

> **Single-Leg Curl:**  
> Set 1: 50 lbs x 10 reps  
> Set 2: 50 lbs x 8 reps  

> **Hip Thrusts:**  
> Set 1: 295 lbs x 10 reps  
> Set 2: 295 lbs x 8 reps  

> **Calf Raises:**  
> Set 1: 390 lbs x 15 reps  
> Set 2: 390 lbs x 12 reps  

Deadlifts felt strong — getting close to 315 for reps. I’ll need to adjust the tempo on calf raises since I’m starting to max out the machine.

Overall, very happy with the session. After 3 weeks on this new program, I’m feeling strong, not overly fatigued, and recovering well. My weight is *kind of* trending in the right direction, but I can’t argue with the strength gains I’m seeing.

Rest day tomorrow.
