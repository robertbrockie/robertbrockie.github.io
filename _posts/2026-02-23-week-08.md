Woke up feeling rested, but there might be a cold coming on. Loaded up on vitamin C and headed into Gold’s this morning for the following push session:

> **Dips:**  
> Set 1: 80 lbs x 12 reps  
> Set 2: 80 lbs x 10 reps  

> **Incline Smith Press:**  
> Set 1: 205 lbs x 7 reps  
> Set 2: 205 lbs x 5 reps  

> **Pec Deck:**  
> Set 1: 220 lbs x 14 reps  
> Set 2: 220 lbs x 10 reps  

> **Cable Lateral Raises:**  
> Set 1: 35 lbs x 15 reps  
> Set 2: 35 lbs x 12 reps  

> **Overhead Rope Extension:**  
> Set 1: 105 lbs x 9 reps  
> Set 2: 100 lbs x 8 reps  

> **Rope Pushdown:**  
> Set 1: 110 lbs x 8 reps  
> Set 2: 110 lbs x 8 reps  

Weighted dips were very strong. However, the setup at Gold’s is such a pain. They don’t have a proper dip belt — just a short chain that’s awkward to load with three plates (45, 25, and 10).

BUT they do have a big 45 lb chain that I can wrap around my neck, then load the smaller chain with two plates (25 and 10) on my waist. Wrapped up on the dip bar like [Jacob Marley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Marley).

Good session overall. Felt strong. With ball hockey tonight, I skipped the elliptical at lunch and focused on carbs and hydration instead.

Heading to bed early and hoping I don’t wake up sick so I can pull some weight tomorrow.

### Notes
