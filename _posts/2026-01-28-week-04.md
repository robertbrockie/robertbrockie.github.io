Great morning leg pump at Gold’s with this session:

- Hack squat  
- Seated leg curl  
- Leg extension  
- Standing leg curl  
- Calf raises  

The lifts felt great, but I was pretty wiped once work started. Caffeinated myself and managed **30 minutes on the elliptical** at lunch.

Other than that, not much to report. I’m leading work’s ab class tomorrow, so I’ll need to sort that out. If I’m feeling recovered enough in the morning, I’ll try to sneak in an early morning shoulders and arms session.

Shorts are still not here, and the last four months of lifts still aren’t fully entered — but first things first, I need to eat. More tomorrow.

### Notes
- Weight at **174.8 lbs**

### TODO
- Research posing and judging  
- Input last 4 months of lifts into the Progress section
