title: "Week 2 – Legs – Calfs or Calves"

Not going to lie, I’m really enjoying the morning lift with afternoon cardio. Hoping I can keep this rhythm going. This morning was legs, set list:

- Hack squat  
- Leg curl  
- Leg extension  
- Calf raises  

Pushed the shit out of my calves today… it *is* calves, right? Not calfs. Fuck. Anyway, finished the session with a ton of raises — they were sore as hell.

Spent the afternoon leading a short ab class for **25 minutes** with my coworkers, then hit **20 minutes on the elliptical**. Followed that up by shoveling some ground chicken and rice down my throat before heading back to work.

It’s also been a solid week for hitting protein goals — and honestly, all macro targets — but the scale isn’t moving as much as I’d like. I’ll reassess and adjust after the end of the week.

### Notes
- Weight steady at **173.4 lbs** 😐

### TODO
- Research posing and judging  
- Graph lift data  
- Buy tiny shorts
