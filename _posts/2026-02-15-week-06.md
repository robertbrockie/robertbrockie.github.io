Rest day today. Didn’t sleep great — I may have ingested a little too much St-Hubert chicken 🍗 last night. Kids had a great time though, so worth it.

Got in **30 minutes on the elliptical** while my youngest was at basketball practice.

Also… big update:

I’m officially registered for **WWA Physique Sports — July 19** 🎟️  
([link here](https://www.workoutwarriorathletics.com/july-19-wwa-physique-sports-montreal))

I’m competing in:
- **Men’s Novice Muscle Physique**
- **Men’s Masters 40+ Muscle Physique**

“Muscle Physique” is basically their version of Classic Physique.

The only downside: I *still* can’t use my fresh new posing trunks. They require more of a square-cut / box-short style. Pain.
