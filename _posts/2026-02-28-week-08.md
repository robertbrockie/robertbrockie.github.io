Hit the sauna for **15 minutes** afterward. Legs felt really strong this morning — I think 315 lbs is there next week.

March Break is next week, so I might shift the rest day around. Possibly train tomorrow and use Wednesday (train ride to [Hogtown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto)) as the rest day instead.

Going to rest up and watch some wrestling with the kids tonight.

### Notes
- Weight at **177.4 lbs**
