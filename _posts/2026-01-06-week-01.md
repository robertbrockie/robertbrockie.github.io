No elliptical today. I’ll be playing curling this evening (need a win), so that’ll count as cardio for the day. Chest felt rested and ready to go, so I hit it with the following set list:

- Incline Smith press  
- Decline barbell press  
- Pec deck  
- Cable press  
- Standing cable flyes  

Excellent chest pump overall, and Gold’s wasn’t as packed today as it was yesterday. That’s a big win — now just give me one more 🥌

### Notes
- Focused on a slow pressing tempo  

### TODO
- Build spreadsheet for weights and reps  
- Research posing and judging
