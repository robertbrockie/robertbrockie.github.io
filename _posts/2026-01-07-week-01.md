Working from home today and slammed, so I didn’t get to the gym until much later than normal. Combined with the start of the new year, I was a little worried about the YMCA’s capacity. Luckily it was pretty empty — mostly cardio users — so I was able to get in another solid leg session.

Set list:

- Leg extensions  
- Leg curls  
- Leg press  
- Calf raises  
- Elliptical (30 minutes)

This combo absolutely kills me every time, in the best way possible. Not as fatiguing as squat days, but the quad pump is unmatched.

On the leg press, I slowly load the 45s and start with single-leg presses at **45 and 90 lbs** to warm up, then build to around **600–700 lbs**, keeping things in the **6–12 rep range**. As I deload, I play with foot placement to really burn out the legs. Today I went full Tom Platz style, with a V-shaped stance — veins popping in the quads. Loved the **vascularity**.

Finished the session with **30 minutes on the elliptical**, then spent some time thinking about diet and current weight trends. This morning’s weigh-in was **172.2 lbs**, which is trending down over the past week, despite increasing protein (and carbs and fats, for that matter).

Need to keep a close eye on this. The goal over the next few weeks is to **put weight back on** so I can hopefully add more muscle before tightening things up later.

### Notes
- Played with foot placement on leg press to burn out the legs  
- Finished leg extensions and leg curls with drop sets to absolute failure
- Keep an eye on weight trend and macro balance 

### TODO
- Build spreadsheet for weights and reps  
- Research posing and judging
