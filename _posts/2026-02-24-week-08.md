Woke up feeling okay — not great, but okay. Slept in (no morning elliptical), ate well, and hydrated enough to make it to a lunch pull session:

> **Pull-ups:**  
> Set 1: +10 lbs x 7 reps  
> Set 2: +10 lbs x 6 reps  

> **Chest-Supported T-Bar Rows:**  
> Set 1: 115 lbs x 10 reps (strapless)  
> Set 2: 115 lbs x 8 reps (with straps)  

> **Close-Grip Seated Rows:**  
> Set 1: 160 lbs x 9 reps (straps)  
> Set 2: 160 lbs x 8 reps (straps)  

> **Reverse Pec Deck:**  
> Set 1: 135 lbs x 12 reps  
> Set 2: 135 lbs x 10 reps  

> **Cable Curls:**  
> Set 1: 110 lbs x 12 reps  
> Set 2: 110 lbs x 10 reps  

Upper back felt great today.

But I’m home now and the cold is definitely setting in. Time for a hot water bottle and some rest.
