Upper body today. Set list:

- Dips (with a big ass 45lb chain)
- Low rows  
- Decline bench press  
- Pull-ups  
- Lateral raises → face pulls  
- Rope curls → rope pulldowns  

Got up early to get the timing right for this session, and it still came in around **45 minutes**. I’ll say it again: this new program is pretty damn good.

Didn’t get a wild pump coming out of it, but I felt strong and not totally drained — which is exactly what I want right now.

Couldn’t make it to the gym at lunch due to a work emergency, but I’ve got curling tonight, so that’ll count as cardio.

Tomorrow is lower body. Time to make a plan. Hope the streak continues.

### Notes
- Weight at **174.0 lbs**

### TODO
- Research posing and judging
