![Brock ab class](/assets/images/bmf-ab-class.png)

Slept *hard* last night. I was exhausted from yesterday’s leg session — or maybe I’m coming down with something. Either way, I woke up feeling very well rested.

Got in **30 minutes on the elliptical** before work.

At lunch I led the team’s ab class, then followed it up with a nice stretch session.

Not much else to report today. Time to prep for tomorrow’s upper body session.

### Notes
- Weight at **176.6 lbs** 👀
