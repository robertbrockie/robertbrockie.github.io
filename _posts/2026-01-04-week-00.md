Had one of the best leg days in recent memory this morning, the setlist was as follows:

- Squats
- Seated Leg Curls
- Seated Leg Extensions
- Standing Calf Raises
- Cable Curls
- Overhead Tricep Extensions
- Tricep Pushdowns
- Oblique Swings
- Sauana (15min)

Great morning at the Y, not many people around which I thought was strange this early into January. Started with squats, building only to 335lbs but focusing on 8-20 rep range. Normally when I squat and I'm feeling in the zone I tend to push closer to 1-rep maxs, but I need to shake that shit from my head. Leg curls were feeling great too, they're new to the rotation and they absolutely stretch my hamstrings.

Finished off the morning with some arm work then hit the sauna. Spent the time in the heat trying to figure out the plan for lifts and cardio as the holidays are over, the kids will be back to school and I'll be back to work tomorrow. I figure morning cardio will be the way, then lift in the afternoons. I hope the Gold's isn't a fucking warren for January. 

Off to meal prep.
