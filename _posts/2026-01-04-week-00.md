Had one of the best leg days in recent memory this morning. The set list was as follows:

- Squats
- Seated leg curls
- Seated leg extensions
- Standing calf raises
- Cable curls
- Overhead triceps extensions
- Triceps pushdowns
- Oblique swings  
- Sauna (15 min)

Great morning at the Y — not many people around, which felt strange this early into January.

Started with squats, building only to **335 lbs**, but focusing on an **8–20 rep range**. Normally, when I’m feeling in the zone, I tend to push closer to one-rep maxes, but I need to shake that mindset. The leg curls felt great too; they’re new to the rotation and absolutely stretch my hamstrings.

Finished the session with some arm work, then hit the sauna. Spent the time in the heat thinking through the plan for lifts and cardio now that the holidays are over — kids back to school, back to work tomorrow.

Morning cardio seems like the move, with lifts in the afternoon. Hopefully Gold’s isn’t a complete fucking warren in January.

Off to meal prep.

### Notes
- Squats felt strong and controlled
- Hamstrings responded well to curls

### TODO
- Lock in cardio and lifting schedule
- Research posing and judging
