Working from home today, so I hit a quad-biased leg day at the YMCA:

- Squats  
- Leg extensions  
- Calf raises  
- Single-leg press  

Another straightforward session — quads felt strong. Hit the sauna for **15 minutes** afterward and worked on some vacuums.

Really missed the hack machine at Gold’s. The back squats were a bit more taxing than usual this morning, but that might also be from not sleeping well last night.

Otherwise, feeling good. Ate well. Going to rest up for tomorrow’s rest day. Ha.
