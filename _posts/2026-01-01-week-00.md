Happy New Year! Big rest day today and I don't feel at all bad about it as my body seems to want it. So I spent the day planning out my nutrition for the coming weeks and the macros I should be hitting.

I'm currently around 175 lbs and the competition (which hasn't been annouced yet) should be in June. So I think these first two months should be spent focusing on building muscle while minimizing fat. With some ~~AI~~ clanker help I've put together the following macro breakdown:

| Calorie Intake | Protein | Carbs | Fats |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2800-3000kcal | 175g – 195g | 350g – 400g | 60g – 75g |

I seem to put on fat easily, so I'm a bit worried about the carbs. The tips that might help this building process are:
 - Consume carbs pre or post workout (for energy)
 - Aim at 0.25 -> 0.5lbs per week, any more dial down the carbs
 - Keep weekly photos to track /s "mirror test"

For meals focus on the following:

**Proteins:** Chicken breast, white fish, lean beef, egg whites, and whey isolate.

**Carbs:** Jasmine rice, cream of rice, sweet potatoes, oats, and pasta.

**Fats:** Avocado, almond butter, extra virgin olive oil, and the fats naturally found in your whole egg and salmon.
