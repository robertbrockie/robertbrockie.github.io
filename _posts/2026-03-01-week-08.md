Been sleeping well the past few nights. Feels like whatever cold was coming on has completely faded.

Skipped the rest day today and hit a push session at the YMCA with the following:

> **Dips:**  
> Set 1: +90 lbs x 10 reps  
> Set 2: +90 lbs x 8 reps  

> **Incline Dumbbell Press:**  
> Set 1: 85 lbs x 10 reps  
> Set 2: 85 lbs x 7 reps  

> **Cable Lateral Raise:**  
> Set 1: 35 lbs x 14 reps  
> Set 2: 35 lbs x 12 reps  

> **Cable Crossover:**  
> Set 1: 50 lbs x 16 reps  
> Set 2: 60 lbs x 10 reps  

> **Overhead Rope Extension:**  
> Set 1: 100 lbs x 12 reps  
> Set 2: 100 lbs x 9 reps  

> **Rope Pushdown:**  
> Set 1: 110 lbs x 7 reps  
> Set 2: 100 lbs x 8 reps  

Four weeks into the new programming and progress is coming along nicely. I haven’t been sore at all, but I’m still feeling very strong. The twinge I had in my left forearm seems to have disappeared completely.

Meal prepped yesterday, so I’m set for sitting on the couch and playing video games with the kids today.

Pull day tomorrow.
