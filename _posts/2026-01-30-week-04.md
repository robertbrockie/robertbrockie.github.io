Started the day with a back session (plus some traps and rear delts):

- T-bar rows  
- Low rows  
- Pulldowns  
- Bent-over reverse flyes  
- Shrugs  
- Pull-ups  

Back felt great afterward. Lunch time was **30 minutes on the elliptical**.

Keeping food intake a bit lower earlier today because I’m taking the kids to a friend’s place later for a pizza party. Will absolutely gorge on pizza and hopefully that gives me all the energy I need to **destroy chest and shoulders** tomorrow morning.

Weight seems to be slowly creeping up. I should probably shut my mouth and just trust the process.

This weekend’s focus: getting more of my previous lifts entered into the Progress section.

### Notes
- Weight at **175.0 lbs**

### TODO
- Research posing and judging  
- Input last 4 months of lifts into the Progress section
