Another quick update — just got back from curling and I’m wiped (again).

This morning’s lift at Gold’s was a pull session:

- Pull-ups  
- Plate-loaded low rows  
- Close-grip cable rows  
- Reverse pec deck  
- Machine preacher curls  

Decent session with a lot of energy. Making solid progress on pull-ups and close-grip rows.

I’m still a bit skeptical of not feeling completely exhausted afterward, but I’m trusting the process.

Got **30 minutes on the elliptical** at lunch, then curling in the evening.

Leg day tomorrow — must conserve energy.

### Notes
- Weight at **173.4 lbs**
