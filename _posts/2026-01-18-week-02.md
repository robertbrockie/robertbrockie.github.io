Long Sunday morning at the Y. Got on the floor at **8 a.m.** to start with legs:

- Squats  
- Lying leg curls  
- Calf raises  
- Leg extensions  

Then picked up my youngest and got him to basketball practice, before heading back to the gym for arms:

- Cable curls  
- Cable pushdowns  
- DB standing curls  
- DB overhead triceps extensions  
- Machine preacher curls  

Dropped him back home, grabbed my oldest, schlepped back to the YMCA, and dropped him off for volleyball practice while I got in a **30-minute incline treadmill** session.

Busy morning, but the good news is I woke up at **174.3 lbs** — that’s an extra **2.5 solid-ass pounds** on. Week-over-week weight is up, so that’s encouraging.

Going to rest up and watch *Fallout* with some rice cakes. Taking tomorrow off as a rest day — ball hockey league is starting back up, so I’ll need to work that back into the schedule.

### Notes
- Weight **up** at **174.3 lbs** 💪

### TODO
- Research posing and judging  
- Graph lift data  
- Buy tiny shorts
