Morning chest session at the YMCA, simple set list:

- Decline bench press  
- Incline DB bench press  
- Standing cable press  
- Dips  

Finished up with a **10-minute sauna**, then caught the bus to the curling rink. We lost in the C quarterfinals.

Back home to meal prep. Not much else to dwell on today. Need to catch up with family and get some rest.

On to week 2!

### Notes
- Weight down to **172.6 lbs**, trending basically flat  
- Up the calories (protein / carbs, minimize the fat)

### TODO
- Build spreadsheet for weights and reps  
- Research posing and judging
