![Brock db bench press](/assets/images/bmf-db-bench-press.png)

Pretty exhausted this morning, but still managed **35 minutes on the elliptical** before heading to work. Lunch-time chest session at Gold’s looked like this:

- Incline Smith machine press  
- Decline bench press  
- Incline dumbbell flyes  
- DB flat bench  

I swapped DB incline flyes in for my usual pec deck. Not convinced I was doing them particularly well — I didn’t get the same squeeze I normally feel with the machine. Still managed a decent chest pump. Check out the IG post below and sound off in the comments 😏.

I’ll see how I feel tomorrow. I’ve been pushing pretty hard this week. Played curling in the evening (played horribly, I might add — awful 2026 for curling so far).

Planning on some back and shoulder work tomorrow, then showing my oldest son how to make pizza.

I’ll focus on getting my sets and reps entered into the blog so I can start graphing some data. But that’s a tomorrow problem — Brock needs rest.

### Notes
- Weight down a smidge at **173.0 lbs** 😐

### TODO
- Research posing and judging  
- Graph lift data  
- Buy tiny shorts
