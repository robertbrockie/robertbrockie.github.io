Got up this morning and played some curling (finally a big win). No lifting today — going to rest and feed a bit. I spent part of the day reading up on how bodybuilding shows actually work. Up until last year, I had no clue how these shows were structured, so I figured I’d read up on it and make some notes for myself.

A competition is made up of a number of divisions, and each division has its own judging criteria. Men’s Physique and Classic Physique are the two that will be offered at the [IDFA](https://www.facebook.com/InternationalDrugFreeAthletics/) show I’ll be doing this year. I put together the notes below to help myself understand the differences (besides the type of shorts).


## 🩴 Men’s Physique  
*“The beach body look”*

Men’s Physique is all about **aesthetics over size**. Judges are looking for something lean, athletic, and clean — not massive.

### Overall look
The emphasis is on:
- Wide shoulders  
- Narrow waist  
- Balanced upper body  
- A convincing **V-taper**

Legs aren’t judged directly since they’re covered by board shorts, so upper-body shape does most of the work.

### Muscularity
Moderate. You should look **shredded and athletic**, not dense or striated.

This is one of the few categories where being *too big* can actually hurt you. If you start looking like a downsized bodybuilder instead of an athletic physique, you’re probably missing the mark.

### Posing
- Front pose  
- Back pose  
- No quads, no deep flexing, no vacuums  

Flow, posture, and confidence matter more than hitting hard poses. You’re wearing board shorts — this is an **upper-body-driven category**.


## 🩲 Classic Physique  
*“The golden-era look”*

Classic Physique is a very different ask. It’s still aesthetic, but it wants **muscle fullness, balance, and flow** across the entire body. Think prime Arnold.

### Overall look
Judges are looking for:
- Symmetry  
- Muscle density  
- Proportion  
- Classic lines  

**Legs matter a lot.** Quads, hamstrings, and glutes are fully visible and heavily judged.

### Muscularity
Noticeably more size than Men’s Physique, especially in the lower body.  
Full quads, thick backs, round delts — unmistakably muscular.

### Posing
- Quarter turns  
- Mandatory poses  
- A freestyle routine  

Vacuum poses, transitions, balance, and presentation all matter. You’re wearing posing trunks.

The goal is classic proportions: shoulders > waist > quads, with everything flowing together.

## Where am I competing?

I’m a stocky guy. A narrow waist is going to be a challenge, and I think I’ve got decent quads — it would be a shame to hide them under board shorts. Because of that, I’m leaning toward **Classic Physique**.

That said, I’m not going to lie: being on stage in tiny trunks is probably going to be the hardest part.


### Notes
- Weight steady at **172.8 lbs**

### TODO
- Build spreadsheet for weights and reps  
- Research posing and judging  
- Buy tiny shorts
