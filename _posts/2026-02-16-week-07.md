Quick update — I just got back from ball hockey and I’m wiped.

Had a bank appointment this morning so I was working from home, which meant I hit the YMCA for a push day:

- Dips  
- DB incline press  
- Pec deck  
- Cable lateral raises  
- Overhead cable rope extensions  
- Pushdowns  

Really wanted to do push at Gold’s since they’ve got the sweet sweet Smith machine, but you gotta make do. Energy was high and I made some decent progress. Finished off with **15 minutes in the sauna**.

Ate well, then got in a hockey game this evening. Hard-fought one — and I’m beat now. Time to rest up for tomorrow’s pull day.

### Notes
- Weight at **175.4 lbs**
