title: "Week 0 – Chest Day - Comp Date"
---

Hitting chest at the YMCA this morning. Warmed up with some cable shoulder work and oblique swings. Those obliques need work and I need to focus on filling out those lower pecs. Today's setlist was pretty simple:

- Decline Bench Press
- Incline DB Press
- Pec Deck
- Machine Chest Press (close grip)
- Incline Treadmill (30mins)

In the future I won't be posting daily here, once work starts up this coming Monday, but will aim for 1-2 posts per week since really I don't have much to say. I'm not a gym philospher like [Sam Sulek](https://www.youtube.com/@sam_sulek) (🐐). However, **big news** [IDAF](https://idfa.ca/) announced their first Montreal competition for July 19th, which gives me more time than I initally thought. Let's bulk the fuck up!

Now I need to learn how to pose! 😬
