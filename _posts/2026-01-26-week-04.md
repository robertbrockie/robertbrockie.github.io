title: "Week 4 – Back – Progress Tracking"

Slept in a bit this morning after a small power outage last night. Start of Week 4 is back day at Gold’s, with the following:

- Seated cable rows  
- T-bar rows  
- Pulldowns  

Not a lot of variety here — probably leaned a bit too hard into rows — but the pump was great. Used straps quite a bit and lifted fairly heavy while still staying in the **8–10 rep range**.

No elliptical today. Had ball hockey in the evening instead (we lost, but it was close — 3–2 game).

As mentioned yesterday, I started tracking my lifts on the [Progress](https://flex.robertbrockie.com/progress/) page. Not everything is in there yet, but I’m graphing both weight and volume progression over time. Still not totally sure this is the best approach, but step one is getting the data in — then I can play with it and adjust.

I also chatted with a trainer friend about when to start cutting. They suggested **three months out** would be more than enough time, which would put the start date around **May 12th**. To be safe, I’ll probably round that down and aim for **May 1st**. This will be the first serious cut I’ve done, so giving myself a bit of extra runway feels smart.

Planning on chest tomorrow — but first, rest.

### Notes
- Weight at **173.6 lbs**

### TODO
- Research posing and judging  
- Input last 4 months of lifts into the Progress section
