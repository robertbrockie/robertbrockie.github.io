Slept in this morning — I’m assuming the glut of evening sports is starting to take its toll. Still got in early enough to squeeze **25 minutes on the elliptical** before work.

Ate well and carbed up before lunch, ready to hit legs. I was feeling a bit down after the Canada vs Czechia game going to OT but while I was shorting up in the locker room I got word that Canada pulled it off.

Mood instantly improved.

Today’s set list:

- Hack squats  
- Leg extensions  
- Single-leg press  
- Calf raises  
- Walking lunges to finish  

One of the Gold’s trainers was using the hack squat machine, but the dude was a real dude and let me work in with him. He was a big dude — and a big grunter — which I love to see, because that means I can grunt it out too. Just a couple of gorillas getting after it 🦍. Best hack squat session I’ve had in a while. Pushed out **315 for 12**.

Once it was all said and done I had a great quad pump — veins, some feathering... finally.

Well-deserved rest day tomorrow.
