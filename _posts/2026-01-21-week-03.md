Morning at Gold’s. Got there early planning to hit back, but the gym was absolutely packed. Someone had parked a water bottle on the T-bar bench and all the squat racks were taken, so I put my belt back in the locker and pivoted to **35 minutes on the elliptical** with a bit of oblique work before heading to the office.

Headed back to the gym at lunchtime, which I’m happy to say was much quieter. Hit the following set list:

- Pull-ups  
- Trap bar deadlifts  
- Bent-over barbell rows  
- T-bar rows  

Easy day overall, though I pushed a bit harder on the T-bar rows to finish. Planning to hit legs tomorrow. Not much else to report — going to eat and rest up.

### Notes
- Weight **still steady** at **173.6 lbs**  

### TODO
- Research posing and judging  
- Graph lift data  
- Buy tiny shorts
