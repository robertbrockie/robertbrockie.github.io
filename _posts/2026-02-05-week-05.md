Just a rest day today. Got in **30 minutes of light elliptical** before work, then ab class + stretching at lunch.

Not going to lie — there was a voice in the back of my head whispering:

> “Go do some arms?”
> “Go get a lil shoulder pump maybe?”
> “You’re not tired… don’t waste the day.”

But I pushed through it and stuck to stretching.

I don’t stretch enough. It shows. And it must be good for me because it sucks.

According to the new plan, tomorrow is upper body.
