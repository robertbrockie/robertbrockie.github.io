All the pills I took last night must have worked. I’m not 100%, but I felt good enough to hit upper body today:

> **Dips:**  
> Set 1: 90 lbs x 9 reps  
> Set 2: 90 lbs x 8 reps  

> **Pull-ups:**  
> Set 1: 10 lbs x 8 reps  
> Set 2: 10 lbs x 6 reps  

> **Incline Dumbbell Press:**  
> Set 1: 80 lbs x 10 reps  
> Set 2: 80 lbs x 8 reps  

> **Chest-Supported Cable Row:**  
> Set 1: 120 lbs x 12 reps  
> Set 2: 120 lbs x 8 reps  

> **Cable Lateral Raises:**  
> Set 1: 35 lbs x 12 reps / side  
> Set 2: 35 lbs x 12 reps / side  

> **Cable Curls:**  
> Set 1: 110 lbs x 12 reps  
> Set 2: 110 lbs x 10 reps  

> **Rope Pushdowns:**  
> Set 1: 110 lbs x 12 reps  
> Set 2: 110 lbs x 8 reps  

Chest felt great, back felt good — overall a decent pump despite the cold.

No cardio today. Had to finish off some work before I’m off for March break.

Curling tonight went well — we won 17–8. We were up 10–0, but they clawed back to make it 10–8 in the 5th 😬

More pills, more sleep. Hoping for a solid lower body session tomorrow.

### Notes
