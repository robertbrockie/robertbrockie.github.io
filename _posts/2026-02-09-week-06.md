After a nice rest day, I hit the first push session of the new program. Set list:

- Decline bench press  
- Incline press (plate-loaded)  
- Cable lateral raises  
- Overhead cable rope extensions  
- Pec deck  

Not a perfect session — I went a bit too heavy on the incline press — but the decline felt great. Lots of blood flow to the tits. Good start to the week.

Lunch time was a light **30 minutes on the elliptical**, and tonight is ball hockey.

## Are lateral raises a pull exercise?

During this push session I caught myself thinking about lateral raises and how they *feel* like a pull exercise. They’re always programmed on push days and I’ve honestly never questioned it.

CoachGPT explained it pretty well:

Lateral raises are **shoulder abduction**, not a pull.

Even though the cable is technically “pulling” on your arm, the **muscle action** is what matters.

Lateral raises train:
- Medial (side) delts  
- Shoulder abduction (arm moving away from the body)

They are:
- ❌ not elbow flexion (biceps)  
- ❌ not shoulder extension (lats / rows)  
- ❌ not scapular retraction (mid-back)  

So from a programming standpoint, they’re a push-day movement — not a pull-day movement.

Thanks coach. Off to hockey, then tomorrow is Pull.
