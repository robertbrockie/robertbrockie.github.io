title: "Week 6 – Upper Body – 🔪"

Friday the 13th.

Got up early this unlucky morning to hit an upper body session at Gold’s:

- Dips  
- Pull-ups  
- DB incline press  
- Low rows  
- Cable lateral raises  
- Rope pushdowns  
- Cable curls  

It was definitely a bit unlucky — the gym was packed. I wanted to do T-bar rows but had to settle for low rows, and I wanted incline Smith press but both machines were taken, so dumbbells it was.

Not a bad session considering. Back felt strong. Chest didn’t get a huge pump, but arms felt great.

Got in **30 minutes on the elliptical** at lunch. No curling tonight.

Going to rest up for tomorrow’s lower body session, and I’m really going to focus on posing and judging this week. Time to clear that fucking TODO list.

### Notes
- Weight at **176.6 lbs** 👀

### TODO
- Research posing and judging
