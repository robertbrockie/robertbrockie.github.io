Slept well last night and felt very rested today. Got in **35 minutes on the elliptical** at lunch, hit my macro targets, and I’m ready for a game of ball hockey this evening. If all goes well, I’ll be up tomorrow to hit chest at the YMCA before working from home.

I was scrolling through Instagram last night and saw a few posts about vacuum pose training. My waist has never been great, so this is yet another thing I clearly need to work on. I went down the rabbit hole a bit — here’s what I found.

## What is the Vacuum Pose?

The vacuum primarily targets the **transversus abdominis (TVA)** — the deepest layer of your abdominal wall. Unlike the “six-pack” (rectus abdominis), which flexes the spine, the TVA acts more like a natural weight belt, pulling the internal organs inward and stabilizing the core.

**Why it matters:**
- **Waist control:** Helps prevent distension or “bubble gut” on stage  
- **Aesthetic taper:** Narrows the waist from the front and side, enhancing the V-taper  
- **Mandatory element:** In Classic Physique, the vacuum is required in poses like the Front Double Biceps

## How to Perform the Vacuum

The goal is to pull your belly button as close to your spine as possible.

1. **Exhale fully**  
   Blow every last bit of air out of your lungs. This is the most important step — without air in your lungs, the diaphragm can rise, allowing the stomach to hollow out.

2. **The draw-in**  
   Without inhaling, pull your navel inward and upward toward your ribcage. Think about trying to touch your spine with your belly button.

3. **Hold & breathe**  
   Once the vacuum is set, take very shallow “sipping” breaths through your chest (not your stomach) to maintain the hold.

4. **Release**  
   Slowly let the air back in and relax the muscle.

## Training Progression (My Roadmap)

Since this is an isometric exercise, it makes sense to train it daily. Everything I’ve read suggests doing these first thing in the morning on an empty stomach.

| Level | Position | Goal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Beginner | **Supine (lying down):** On your back, knees bent. Gravity helps the stomach sink. | 3 × 20-sec holds |
| Intermediate | **Quadruped (all fours):** Hands and knees, now working against gravity. | 3 × 30-sec holds |
| Advanced | **Seated or standing:** Upright with no back support — closer to stage conditions. | 4 × 40-sec holds |
| Pro / Stage | **In-pose:** Holding a Front Double Biceps or Abs & Thighs. | 5 × 15-sec holds |
