Working from home today, so I got a morning session in at the Y. Hit arms with the following:

- Cable curls  
- Rope pushdowns  
- Preacher curls  
- Skull crushers  
- Incline seated DB curls  
- Standing overhead triceps extensions  
- Wrist curls  
- Reverse wrist curls  

Finished up with **15 minutes in the sauna** before heading home to work. Used that time to start some vacuum training and, inevitably, think about the scale — which is down again today.

I need to stop focusing on it day to day and just eat more until mid-February, then worry about maintenance or a cut. Plan is to hit chest and shoulders tomorrow. For now: eat.

### Notes
- Weight **down** at **173.8 lbs** 😑  

### TODO
- Research posing and judging  
- Graph lift data  
- Buy tiny shorts
