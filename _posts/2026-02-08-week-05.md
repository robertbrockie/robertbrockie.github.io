Rest day today. Woke up feeling a little sore (the good kind) in the hamstrings. Honestly, I’m happy even a few exercises triggered that — I haven’t felt anything but stiffness the next morning in a long time. Prayers up for muscle growth.

My shorts arrived from Australia today. They look better than I expected, and I’m genuinely happy with them.

However…

While watching the Olympics coverage today (Canada really shat the bed in Mixed Doubles curling), I started reading the judging criteria for the competition. And I found this:

### Required Attire
- Fitted athletic shorts  
- Square-cut or “dad short” style  
- Approximately **3–4 inch inseam**  

So… I’ve got to look for new shorts.

Fuck.

I guess now I need to place in this competition so I can wear these bad boys on *another* stage.

Push day tomorrow. Time to meal prep.

### Notes
- Weight at **175.4 lbs**

### TODO
- Research posing and judging
