## The What?

This site documents my training, nutrition, and accumulated lifting opinions while preparing for a bodybuilding competition.

I’ve been training for a long time without a tangible goal. Now that there *is* one, I figured I might as well log the trials, errors, minor victories, and occasional questionable decisions that come with prep.

If nothing else, this will serve as some form of accountability — and hopefully be useful later when I forget why I decided any of this was a good idea.

## The Goal

🏆 [IDFA](https://www.idfa.ca/) Men’s Bodybuilding Competition — **July 19, 2026**

If you’re curious how a prep is managed over time, this is my record. Comments are enabled, so feel free to tell me what you like — or don’t.
