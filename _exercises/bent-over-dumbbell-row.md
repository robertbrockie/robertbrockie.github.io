title: Bent Over Dumbbell Row
type: exercise
group: back
primary_muscles: [lats, mid-back]
secondary_muscles: [rear-delts, biceps, spinal-erectors]

## Why I use it
- Great unilateral row for building lats + mid-back
- Easy to progress with reps, tempo, and load
- Lets you match left/right strength

## Setup
- Hinge until torso is ~30–45° to the floor
- Brace core, keep ribs down
- Let the dumbbells hang under shoulders (not out in front)

## Execution cues
- **Drive elbow toward the hip** (not straight up)
- Keep the shoulder **down and back**
- Pause 0.5–1s at the top, then lower under control
- Weights should go to your pocket, not your ribs, to further engage the lats,
- You want to get your elbow above your back and try to really squeeze into the back muscles. Think of trying to wrap your elbow over your back.
- You need a slow, controlled eccentric. I aim for feeling like i can stop the descent at any time in the motion. 

## Common mistakes
- Rounding lower back (reduce load, hinge less, brace harder)
- Using momentum / twisting (slow the lowering phase)
- Elbow flaring too wide (hits rear delt more than lat)

## Programming ideas
- Hypertrophy: **3–4 × 8–12**
- Strength-biased: **4–5 × 6–8**
- Technique/feel: **2–3 × 12–15** with a pause

## Variations
- Chest-supported DB row (less lower-back fatigue)
- One-arm DB row (bench-supported)
- Cable row (more constant tension)
